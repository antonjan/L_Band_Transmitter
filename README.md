# L_Band_Transmitter
This project will be sharing the L Band Transmitter for a possible transponder.
This design will contain the 1.2 Ghz transmitter with IQ SDR Modulator and Local oscillator.
The board will be drivin from a STM32F407 microcontroller which will produce the IQ modulation. (AFSK FM and SSB)
This Project will contain the Kicad Design and PCB with posible driver software.
